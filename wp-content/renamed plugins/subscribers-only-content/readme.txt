== Description ==

Allows blog admin to set specific pages and posts to only be visible to users set as subscriber and above (with the 'read' capability).

This allows certain content to be blocked so that only logged-in users can read it.

Requirements:

*   "php5" - I'm a big proponent of dropping the php4 compatibility of WordPress due to the improved OO support.  Because of this, I prefer to write my plugins in php5 form in hopes to help push the community along.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `subscribers-only-content` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
